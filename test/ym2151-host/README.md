# YM2151 Host Test

---

## Why This Exists

The YM2151 is a complex FM synthesis chip used in many arcade and console systems.  
Before integrating it into embedded or game projects, we want to:

- Verify correct emulation using YMFM on a full desktop system.
- Compare host output with Pico output.
- Experiment with register programming and patch creation.
- Check real-time audio output and performance characteristics.
- Debug without the constraints of embedded hardware.
