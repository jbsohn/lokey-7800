# LOKEY-Pokey-7800

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early-stage hardware/firmware project. Unstable, experimental, and *loud*.**  
> You found this before it‚Äôs even ‚Äúalpha‚Äù‚Äîwelcome, intrepid hacker.

**LOKEY-Pokey-7800** is the missing link between our portable POKEY audio core (**liblokey**)‚Äîalready running on the Raspberry Pi Pico‚Äîand real Atari 7800 hardware.

- **liblokey** runs accurate POKEY emulation on the RP2040 (Pico), combining the best of Atari800 and OpenEmu ProSystem 7800 Core codebases.
- **This project** adapts and deploys that engine *as a real hardware add-on*‚Äîa cartridge-ready sound solution for the Atari 7800, plus future support for tracker formats like MOD/XM.

**Best of all: the RP2040 costs just a few bucks per cart.**  
*No more hoarding rare chips. Modern sound‚Äîaffordably‚Äîfor every new game.*

## Architecture

- **liblokey:**  
  Portable, embeddable POKEY/audio library with a clean C/C++ API.  
  Runs and tested on the Pico (RP2040), desktop, and web.  
  Core audio engine here: [liblokey](https://github.com/YOURNAME/liblokey)
- **This project:**  
  Firmware and hardware ‚Äúglue‚Äù for the 7800.  
  Brings everything together:
    - Emulates POKEY audio (using code from Atari800 and OpenEmu ProSystem 7800 Core)
    - Handles 7800 cartridge bus comms
    - Outputs audio via pin 38 (POKEY_OUT)
    - Plans for MOD/XM tracker support (via [libxm](https://github.com/Artefact2/libxm))
    - Host/desktop SDL test harness for rapid dev

---

## Features (In Progress)

- **POKEY audio emulation on real hardware** (tested on Pico via liblokey)
- **MOD/XM tracker support** (coming soon)
- **Cartridge-compatible design**
    - 27C256 EPROM + RP2040 on a single board
    - Pin 38 = audio, pin 36 = ground
    - Dev and release on the same hardware!
- **Low cost:**
    - RP2040 is cheap, hobbyist-friendly, and in-production now
    - Goodbye, expensive/hard-to-find POKEY chips!
- **Desktop/host test apps** (SDL)
- **All code GPLv2**

## Why?

- POKEY chips are rare‚Äîhomebrew shouldn‚Äôt depend on 1980s silicon supply chains.
- Let 7800 homebrew have *real* music and new effects.
- Fast dev iteration: same board for testing and production.
- **Affordable:** New ‚Äúsound chip‚Äù for every cart, just a few bucks each.
- Futureproof: tracker formats, more advanced engines, whatever you invent next.

---

## Status

- **Proven:** liblokey runs on Pico; POKEY audio works!
- **This repo:** Now wiring it up for full 7800 support‚Äîhardware, firmware, and integration in progress.
- Old files are being cleared; new structure rolling out.
- Expect noise, hacks, and hot glue (metaphorically and maybe literally).
- 7800 homebrew nerds, join us!

## AI-Assisted Development

This project wouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîat least not as a one-person, evenings-and-weekends effort‚Äîwithout real, practical help from AI. ChatGPT and related tools have made it possible to tackle firmware, C++ refactors, embedded hardware, and documentation at a speed that just isn‚Äôt realistic solo.
