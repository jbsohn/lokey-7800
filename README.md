# LOKEY-Pokey-7800

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early-stage hardware/firmware project. Unstable, experimental, and *loud*.**  
> You found this before it‚Äôs even ‚Äúalpha‚Äù ‚Äî welcome!

**LOKEY-Pokey-7800** is the missing link between our portable POKEY audio core (**liblokey**)‚Äîalready running on the
Raspberry Pi Pico‚Äîand real Atari 7800 hardware.

- **liblokey** runs accurate POKEY emulation on the RP2040 (Pico), combining the best of Atari800 and OpenEmu ProSystem
  7800 Core codebases.
- **Nuked-OPM YM2151** emulation now integrated for future dual-chip audio projects.
- **This project** adapts and deploys those engines *as a real hardware add-on*‚Äîa cartridge-ready sound solution for the
  Atari 7800, plus planned tracker support.

**Best of all: the RP2040 costs just a few bucks per cart.**  
*No more hoarding rare chips. Modern sound‚Äîaffordably‚Äîfor every new game.*

## Architecture

- **liblokey:**  
  Portable, embeddable POKEY/audio library with a clean C/C++ API.  
  Runs and tested on the Pico (RP2040) and desktop.  
  *(WASM builds not yet implemented in liblokey/libPOKEY)*  
  Core audio engine here: [liblokey](https://github.com/jbsohn/liblokey)
- **Nuked-OPM YM2151:**  
  High-accuracy FM synthesis core now included for YM-based 7800+ projects.
- **This project:**  
  Firmware and hardware ‚Äúglue‚Äù for the 7800.  
  Brings everything together:
    - Emulates POKEY audio (Atari800 and ProSystem 7800 cores)
    - Emulates YM2151 audio via Nuked-OPM
    - Handles 7800 cartridge bus comms
    - Outputs audio via pin 38 (POKEY_OUT)

## Features (In Progress)

- **POKEY audio emulation on real hardware** (tested on Pico via liblokey)
- **YM2151 FM synthesis emulation** (via Nuked-OPM)
- **MOD/XM tracker support** ‚Äî *planned but on hold* (via [libxm](https://github.com/Artefact2/libxm))
- **Cartridge-compatible design**
    - 27C256 EPROM + RP2040 on a single board
    - Pin 38 = audio, pin 36 = ground
- **Low cost:**
    - RP2040 is cheap, hobbyist-friendly, and in-production now
- **Desktop/host test apps** (SDL)
- **All code GPLv2**

---

## Status

- **Proven:** liblokey runs on Pico; POKEY audio works!
- **YM2151 integration complete** ‚Äî ready for Pico testing.
- **libxm integration on hold** until core chip work is finalized.
- This repo: Wiring up for full 7800 support‚Äîhardware, firmware, and integration in progress.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project wouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîat least not as a one-person, evenings-and-weekends effort‚Äîwithout real, practical help from
AI. ChatGPT and related tools have made it possible to tackle firmware, C++ refactors, embedded hardware, and
documentation at a speed that just isn‚Äôt realistic solo.
