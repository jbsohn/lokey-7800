# LOKEY-7800

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early-stage hardware/firmware project. Unstable, experimental, and *loud*.**

**LOKEY-7800** goal is to be the missing link between our portable POKEY audio core (**liblokey**)‚Äîalready running on the Raspberry Pi Pico‚Äîand real Atari 7800 hardware.

- **[liblokey](https://github.com/jbsohn/liblokey)** runs accurate POKEY emulation on the RP2040 (Pico), combining the best of Atari800 and OpenEmu ProSystem 7800 Core codebases.
- **[YMFM](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm) YM2151** emulation is in its earliest stages: we‚Äôre currently generating a basic tone on Pico hardware‚Äîfull YM-based audio is planned for the future.
- **This project** adapts and deploys those engines *as a real hardware add-on*‚Äîa cartridge-ready sound solution for the Atari 7800, plus planned tracker support.
- **Pico-to-pico communication** now working, simulating Atari 7800-to-cartridge bus transactions‚Äîproving our I/O and timing approach before real hardware arrives.

**Best of all: the RP2040 costs just a few bucks per cart.**  
*No more hoarding rare chips. Modern sound‚Äîaffordably‚Äîfor every new game.*

## Our Philosophy

Let‚Äôs be honest: If new POKEY and YM2151 chips were still in production at reasonable prices, we‚Äôd just use those.  
But they‚Äôre not‚Äîand the only way to bring classic sound to modern 7800 carts is to experiment, iterate, and see what‚Äôs possible with today‚Äôs tech.

**Will it work?**  
We honestly don‚Äôt know! That‚Äôs the fun. Half the joy is figuring it out as we go, solving problems in public, and maybe even failing a few times along the way. If we get there and it all comes together, awesome. If not, at least we‚Äôll know *why*‚Äîand share what we learn.

## Architecture Goals

- **liblokey:**  
  Portable, embeddable POKEY/audio library with a clean C/C++ API.  
  Runs and tested on the Pico (RP2040) and desktop.
- **YMFM YM2151:**  
  High-accuracy FM synthesis core‚Äî*very early stages*: currently generating a single tone on Pico; full YM2151 audio not yet implemented.
- **This project:**  
  Firmware and hardware ‚Äúglue‚Äù for the 7800.  
  Brings everything together:
    - Emulates POKEY audio (Atari800 and ProSystem 7800 cores)
    - Early YM2151 (YMFM) audio experiments
    - Handles 7800 cartridge bus comms
    - Outputs audio via pin 38 (POKEY_OUT)

## Features (In Progress)

- **POKEY audio emulation on real hardware** (tested on Pico via liblokey)
- **YM2151 FM synthesis emulation** (*very early: currently generates a simple tone on Pico; full YM2151 support TBD*)
- **Pico-to-pico communication** for simulated 7800-to-cartridge testing (proven functional)
- **MOD/XM tracker support** ‚Äî *planned but on hold* (via [libxm](https://github.com/Artefact2/libxm))
- **Cartridge-compatible design**
    - 27C256 EPROM + RP2040 on a single board
    - Pin 38 = audio, pin 36 = ground
- **Low cost:**
    - RP2040 is cheap, hobbyist-friendly, and in-production now
- **Desktop/host test apps** (SDL)
- **All code GPLv2**

---

## Status

- **Proven:** liblokey runs on Pico; POKEY audio works!
- **Pico-to-pico communication working:** Simulates Atari 7800-to-cartridge communication for full-speed bus testing and development.
- **YM2151 (YMFM) is in the earliest proof-of-concept stage:** currently generates a simple tone on Pico hardware. Full YM support and integration are planned, but POKEY is our main concentration point.
- **libxm integration on hold** until core chip work is finalized.
- This repo: Wiring up for full 7800 support‚Äîhardware, firmware, and integration in progress.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project wouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîat least not as a one-person, evenings-and-weekends effort‚Äîwithout real, practical help from AI. ChatGPT and related tools have made it possible to tackle firmware, C++ refactors, embedded hardware, and documentation at a speed that just isn‚Äôt realistic solo.
